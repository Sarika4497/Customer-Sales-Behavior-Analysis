# Customer-Sales-Behavior-Analysis
End-to-End Data Analytics Project Report
1. Executive Summary

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow designed to convert raw customer shopping data into meaningful business insights.
Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, the analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior, purchase drivers, and loyalty patterns to support data-driven business decisions.

The final outcome is an interactive dashboard and business-ready insights that can help organizations improve customer retention, optimize product strategies, and increase revenue.

2. Business Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

To analyze customer shopping behavior and purchasing patterns

To identify high-value customers and loyalty trends

To understand key factors influencing customer purchases

To provide actionable recommendations for business growth

3. Tools & Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis
SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / MS SQL Server)	Business queries and analytical insights
Power BI	Interactive dashboard and visualization
Jupyter Notebook	Data preparation and SQL data loading
Git / Documentation	Project versioning and reporting
4. Dataset Overview

The dataset contains customer shopping behavior data, including:

Customer demographics

Purchase frequency

Product categories

Payment methods

Loyalty and spending behavior

The data simulates real-world retail transactions to reflect practical business scenarios.

5. Data Preparation & Cleaning (Python)
Key Steps Performed:

Imported raw dataset into Jupyter Notebook

Checked for missing values and duplicates

Standardized column names and data types

Handled null values using appropriate business logic

Created new calculated fields for analysis (e.g., total spend, purchase frequency)

Outcome:

Clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset

6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to identify trends and anomalies:

Distribution of customers across categories

Spending patterns by customer segments

Relationship between loyalty and purchase frequency

Identification of top-performing product categories

Insights from EDA guided the SQL analysis and dashboard design.

7. Database Creation & Data Loading (SQL)
Steps:

Created a new database in SQL

Designed tables matching the cleaned dataset schema

Loaded data from Python into SQL using database connectors

Validated records to ensure data consistency

This step simulates real-world data engineering workflows.

8. Business Analysis Using SQL

Business questions were answered using optimized SQL queries, including:

Who are the top-spending customers?

Which customer segments generate the most revenue?

How does loyalty impact purchase behavior?

What products and categories drive repeat purchases?

SQL queries were saved in customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql for reusability.

9. Power BI Dashboard
Dashboard Features:

Customer segmentation analysis

Revenue trends and spending patterns

Loyalty vs purchase frequency visuals

Category-wise and payment-method insights

The dashboard enables stakeholders to:

Filter by customer segment

Identify high-value customers

Monitor performance trends interactively

10. Key Insights

Loyal customers contribute significantly higher revenue

Certain product categories drive repeat purchases

A small percentage of customers account for a large share of sales

Purchase frequency is strongly linked to customer retention

11. Business Recommendations

Focus on loyalty programs to retain high-value customers

Target marketing campaigns toward frequent buyers

Optimize inventory based on high-performing categories

Personalize offers using customer purchase history

12. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a corporate-grade analytics workflow, from raw data to strategic insights.
It highlights strong capabilities in data cleaning, SQL analysis, visualization, and business storytelling, making it highly relevant for real-world data analyst roles.
